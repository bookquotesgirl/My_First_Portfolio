<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p> Hi. My name is Hiwot Abere. I am currently a software engineering student honing my skills in building innovative<br>
and impactful software solutions. I am constantly exploring new ways to bridge the gap between ideas and implementation.<br>
</p>
<p>
Through my academic journey and personal projects, I’ve gained hands-on experience in programming, software design, and <br>
team collaboration. My goal is to create efficient, scalable, and user-friendly software that makes a difference in people's lives.<br>
When I’m not coding, I enjoy reading and writing.
</p>
<p>Feel free to explore my portfolio and see the projects I’ve been working on. I’d love to connect and collaborate!</p>
